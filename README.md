# Piacob-broad
 Project developed in Python that automates the IACOB-broad program. PIACOB-BROAD is the main program used to read real spectra of massive stars in 'asc' or '.fits' format, then determine a Gaussian fit, and finally specify a spectral window to calculate the Fourier transform of both profiles, in order to determine the rotational velocity of the star.
 Additionally, the auxiliary programs "utils" and "convol" are included, together with the original IACOB-BROAD program written in ID
